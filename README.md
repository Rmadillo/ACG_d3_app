# Demo interactive app for evaluating ACG model results

This is a d3 app based on prior work by Kai Chang that allows a user to interact with a multidimensional data set. This particular use is for exploring the results of Johns Hopkins' Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) model for a fake set of patients and hospitals. We used this app (with real data, of course!) at Group Health Cooperative in 2014 to help prioritize patient intervention for enrollment in critical care management.
